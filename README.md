# ID 2020 Design Workshop

This repository contains documents related to the Design Workshop Event following the UN ID 2020 Summit on identity

## Design Workshop May 21rd & 22th, 2016

The DesignShop event, to be held in the New York on May 21rd & 22th 2015.The event focuses on creating the next generation of decentralized web-of-trust based identity systems. The goal of this initial DesignShop is to generate 5 technical white papers and/or proposals on topics decided by the group that will have the greatest impact on the future.

### Topics & Advance Readings

In advance of the ID 2020 Design DesignShop, all participants were requested to submit a 1 or 2 page topics paper to be shared with other attendees on either:
* A specific decentralized identity use case related to the topic of the UN ID 2020 Summit
* A specific problem that you'd like to solve with a decentralized or web-of-trust solution, and why current solutions (pgp or ca-based pki) can't address the problem
* A specific solution related to the decentralized identity or web-of-trust that you'd like others to use or contribute to
