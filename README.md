## Rebooting the Web of Trust II: ID2020 (May 2016)

This repository contains documents related to RWOT2, the second Rebooting the Web of Trust design workshop, which ran in San Francisco, CA, on May 21st & 22nd, 2016. It was run in conjunction with the UN ID2020 Summit on Identity, which occurred at the UN in New York on May 20th, 2016. The goal of the workshop was to generate five technical white papers and/or proposals on topics decided by the group that would have the greatest impact on the future.

_Please see the [Web of Trust Info website](http://www.weboftrust.info/) for more information about our community, including upcoming events._

##  Topics & Advance Readings

In advance of the ID 2020 Design DesignShop, all participants were requested to submit a 1 or 2 page topics paper to be shared with other attendees on either:

* A specific decentralized identity use case related to the topic of the UN ID 2020 Summit
* A specific problem that they wanted to solve with a web-of-trust solution, and why current solutions (PGP or CA-based PKI) can't address the problem?
*  A specific solution related to the web-of-trust that you'd like others to use or contribute to?

Please see the [Advance Readings README](topics-and-advance-readings/README.md) for a listing of all of the papers.
