He who I was yesterday
Is not he who I am today - 
Now which one of the two 
Would be my true self?

Outline:

###1. Introduction


####Problem Statement - Clarification of facets of Identity.
	
In order to build a system that works we should look at what identities we have today and mimic this world, not ask people to fit into our technology.
	
###2. What is Identity?

*Input from Kaliya’s paper - need to summarize it here*

In November 2015 Facebook's share price broke $100 USD/share, for a total valuation of $290 billion USD. This is evidence that both Facebook and the market understand the value of controlling and leveraging personal data. However, the now-conventional absorb-everything design of Facebook is a blunt one. Employing users as passive producers with no control of their own data only scratches the surface of what is possible with networks of information and identity.
Some of these constraints arise from Facebook's centralization, something that tends to worsen as an organization grows in size. There are limits to the amount of trust this sort of centralized authority can garner. This often results in punitive postures: democracies come with the expectation that citizens be forever watchful of their government; while corporations are watched over by regulatory bureaus and further deterred by class-action suits.
Decentralized systems that are engineered to prevent concentrating power as they grow avoid this. They can in fact increase their credibility as more users provide their assessments as input. Protocols and structures that are distributed and self- sovereign also offer significantly improved robustness, portability, and versatility than conventional centralized or escrowed processes — especially when combined with secure cryptography.
One of the first technologies to offer the advantages of decentralization emerged 25 years ago when the advent of PGP realized a Web of Trust that contained decentralized, cryptographically verified attestations of its users. Unfortunately, failures of UX design confined the spread of PGP to highly technical communities.
Today, decentralized Webs of Trust remain as important as ever. Now is the time to extend them to be usable by everyone who has access to digital networks, in particular to marginalized populations that can benefit from the technology. It is a fortunate tragedy that there is no shortage of real-life examples of the need for decentralized Webs of Trust in the world today. A large spectrum of individuals — from marginalized persons like stateless refugees and victims of human trafficking to members of the informal or unregulated economy — urgently need to participate in otherwise privileged economic and political fora, but they face technical, economic, and political barriers to entry.The essential problem is to connect burgeoning new technological developments with unmet consumer needs, and vice-versa. In this paper, we present five use cases: from two relatively simple cases of managing selective disclosure to the most extreme case of establishing government-verifiable credentials from nothing for a stateless refugee.Each case identifies basic technical implementation needs, presents a brief solution sketch, and outlines potential user experience. Afterward, we discuss common themes and summarize future prospects.

*Use Cases*
1. Selective Disclosure: Proof of Age2. Short-term Contracts with Memory: Distributed AirBnB3. Bootstrapping Long-Term Identity: Creating A Record of Credit4. Concerns in Non-G20 Nations5. Starting From Zero: Refugee6. Human Trafficking: Exiting Safe Houses

###3. What are the identity types?

We have identified the following types of identities:

1. **I online** - Who I am online, my identity on the internet
1. **Virtual me** - My accounts, for shopping and otherwise. Information that is collected about me. 
1. **Fiat** - Government or State issued Identities
1. **Agency License** - Identities that are issued by authorities, but not governments, for instance pilot or medical license. 
1. **Physical Social** - Me in a social context in real world. A mother, a husband, a friend
1. **Online Social** - Me in social media.
1. **Me Offline** - My physical self
1. **Sum** - The core of me. What creates me, how I define myself, what describes me best?

###4. Taxonomy of Interactions.
	
What Kaliya proposed on the whiteboard

From Kaliya's paper:

*Local Affinity*
	The first corner is Local Affinity. This is when people that live near each other meet on a frequent cyclical basis – weekly/monthly. Examples would be a basketball team, knitting circle, service club, religious congregation, events linking professional interests Macintosh User Groups or social purpose like Eco-Tuesday.
	
These kinds of events happen on an ongoing basis. On this scale, with meetings happening regularly, several things would be good to have.- it would be great to have each event have its own “home page” where documentation from the event was stored along with pictures taken and who was there.- it would be handy to be able to do a search of people in that community based on who was at meetings I was at.
The focus of this kind of community site is on helping support the deepening of relationships, for members to support each other because they are both local and interested in the same “thing”.

*Non-Local Affinity*
	The next corner is Non-Local Affinity this is for events and spaces where one escapes local geography to be with peers from all over who share interests. This “escape from geography” can happen at different scales
	- local groups from throughout the bay area meet once a quarter for a pan-bay area meeting- people from all over the country gather once a year at a conference on a topic they share in common like Open Source or Dialogue and Deliberation- people from all over the world gather once ever 10 years to discuss population growth
These events are powerful because they build relationships rooted in common interest beyond the local.
	They provide an opportunity to find people locally you didn’t know who share your interest and potentially to begin a local affinity group (or find one to join because previously you didn’t know it existed).
	The level of connection one wants with these people depending on context. In technical communities the ongoing interaction amongst non-local affinity clusters is intense talking on IRC’s constantly.
	One doesn’t necessarily want to be connected in the same way to these people non- local affinity people as you are to your local affinity. It is great to have a directory of who was there and what they are interested in.
	
	*Weaving Local and Non-Local Affinity Events/Communities Together*
	The links between these two quadrants are important for deepening and enriching communities.*Non-Local to Local*When you escape your local geography because you are drawn to a particular conference because of an interest in a topic it is an opportunity to find other people who live near you who have done the same. My experience national conferences don’t create enough time/space opportunity to support people connecting to those who live near them at national events. Nor do they do this via e-mail or online spaces.
	From my real life example at the National Coalition on Dialogue and Deliberation the local Bay Area based community of practice Fabulous Facilitators can connect to facilitators at the national conference who did not know about the local group and expand.	
At an event like Open Source Convention is an opportunity for those interested in a particular language to find local user groups around different languages and platforms.These two examples both happen today on an ad-hoc basis not in an organized fashion. A conception of non-local affinity online life linking to local affinity groups would be helpful in strengthening activity in both quadrants.
	*Local to Non-Local*
	It would be quite simply overwhelming to read a feed of all activity of all local groups around a particular affinity. What is of value is having the best of of highlights pushed up to get an overall sense of activity and highlight particularly interesting work.
	A well known example where this happened was the Howard Dean Campaign where local sites for Deaniacs pushed up highlights to the state level site and then those state level sites pushed up content to a national level. What was even more interesting was the feedback loop – a feed from the national campaign was pulled back down to the state and local groups helping information flow.
	*Why does this matter*National scale organizations that have regional chapters should consider how to empower and link local communities and support their face to face connection in community better. Understanding this dynamic between affinity and the desire to connect locally can also support larger national coalitions around issue areas supporting “members” from a diversity of groups coming together locally.
*Local Non-Affinity*
	The third quadrant is the Local Non-Affinity is where community activity across the diverse activities within a geographic region are aggregated and issues that affect the overall community. This is one of the most important quadrants that has been given little attention.I should be able to go to my city and see all the activities happening in neighborhood or city – to engage with neighbors. I should be able to see profiles they have as they are as neighbors in place what they have to offer their neighbors as services or things to share.Many neighborhood associations have mailing lists and may have static sites but there are almost no systemic aggregation of events. Community newspapers and radiostations invite community groups to send in listings but this is all very analogue. Community sites with a diversity of local groups would aggregate information about the arts, cultural activities, opportunities for improving the community, service opportunities.
		There are some attempts to aggregate information like this (my hope is that in the Social Web Foo Camp session we can cover what exists and what is missing)
	- Outside.in brings together blogs in local places.* Some local newspaper “platforms” that I have seen have some of this functionality.A community of who’s who in the geography could be there and support community engagement – with information about what people would like their neighbors to know what things they have to lend or services they have to offer.
	- Some local community currency sites do this.* There is a site called Community Weaving that does some of this.
	*Weaving Local Affinity and and Local Non-Affinity Events/Communities Together*
	The Local Non-Affinity kinds of sites are where information from a diversity of local affinity groups is aggregated and made search able. There should also be feeds flowing from local non-affinity sites to sites of local affinity groups to help them connect and know about things happening locally. People search should be enabled across local community sites.
		*Non-Local, Non-Affinity*This corner is to be is what makes national governance really hard – lots of people who don’t live and don’t have much. It is what makes national governance hard. I think it is also one of the issues that make “mass” social networks feel overwhelming. This corner can is what can be perceived as “diverse” really it is best to be avoided and look for fostering diversity and inter connection between different non-local affinity groups and in linking local affinity groups together in the
	Some coalitions around broad issues that affect diverse communities can have success in this space. An example would be Save the Internet coalition that included the NRA, Focus on the Family and MoveON.
	*Issues blocking migration to this model & steps to get there.* 
I hope to cover this at the Social Web Foo Camp session these are some initial thoughts
	- Usable identifiers for People	
After many years of working on this some progress has been made but OpenID seems
	
- Groups as First Class Objects
- Standards for event publishing that include geodata that have wide adoption by really basic community sites
- Migration paths for communities from the mailing list form to more social network
- Community Organizing Tools, Group Tools that are designed by community organizers for community organizers for all three quadrants the tools need to be de
- Relationships as First Class Objects
- Context management for people
- People search across distributed networks of interest areas.

### 5. What are the characteristics of various types? 

*(description of the table and observations)*
	
We made a possibly important observation: specifically that the “I Online” column and the “Sum” column match exactly.  Reflecting upon this we wondered if this is actually no coincidence: in every other case we are dealing with various inconvenient evolutionary or physical limits that are not in our [WORD] to change, but we created the online space entirely ourselves, so it only makes sense that the idealized online identity should aim to represent the way we would want to be perceived and to express aspects of identity.
	
[Note: I cut out the word “social contracts”.  I liked it but it didn’t seem to fit.]
 
This further leads to a very important position on use cases for Self-Sovereign Identity: should we accept that the only place we can truly have SSI is in a virtual context.  DIGITAL identity can be self-sovereign.  DIGITIZED identity cannot.

###6. Conclusions	
	
Why do we need Online Identity? because Self sovereign identity can only be online. 




************************
###Random thoughts I want to put in:

Process of socialization is an interesting one. How much of it is us gaining identity in social terms versus us loosing our sum, our personality. We get adjusted, fitted, but we loose what our core is. We learn what is good or bad, what we can do. 

What’d does socialization mean? Is it actually giving up identity or maybe gaining new facets of it? How much do we have to sacrifice as we try to fit in? 

We are born as tabula rasa. With no pre-built beliefs or understanding what the world is or how it functions. We learn, just like animals - by mimicking our parents and environment. And by trying and being punished or encouraged. Does that mean that we only have our true identity at the moment of birth? What happens afterwards is destroying it and shaping it to fit the society needs? Indeed, we are told that there are behaviors that are not appropriate, that are not socially acceptable. We learn that so many of the things we have a natural urge to do, are things we should not be even approaching - sexuality  being the key example of it. On the other hand, given the right group of peers, many rediscover that what they wanted is acceptable. So there are no "objective" social norms. They depend on the environment. But our sum is objectively who we are. So when we adjust our sum, we change the core of ourselves risking that we are destroying something precious for something temporarily easy.

What is an identity? In psychology identity or self-concept is not connected to anything physical. According to Encyclopedia Britannica “it has to do with what the truth of judgments of personal identity consists of and how it can be known. Equivalently, it has to do with the nature of the persistence of persons through time and their awareness of such persistence”. It is liberating: I think therefore I am.
Sticking only to this definition is a double edged sword, however: no one can deny me who I am. The government can deny me my documents not my identity. Identity is something I have as a person. But: from a practical standpoint of view, my cogito may not help the authorities protect my sum. The fact I make judgment, may help me by making a choice not to take up a shady job. It will not l not help police find me when I am kidnapped. Being a document less individual is enough when one does not need anything from the society, when they want to be an Island. We need documents that prove who we are, that prove our Personal Data, when we choose to be part of a society.
Socialization, or becoming a citizen, means that we give up some anonymity (though ideally not privacy!) by providing some personally identifiable information to a trusted institution - like the government - and in return receive a document that guarantees that we are, who we claim we are. The most interesting part of a paper identification is that it is a disposable document. In some countries, like Germany, one is not required to carry around an ID. I leave my house, leave the passport behind and am an island again. Because the government holds a copy of my data, they have methods of identifying me, even if I loose all my paper document. That is a truly double edged sword, again. Once delegating the power to grant me the proof of identity I also agree to delegation of the power to deny that proof. And I need to trust they will not abuse that power.
